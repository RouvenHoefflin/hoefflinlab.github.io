The Hefflin lab is combining computational and experimental methods to study human tumors as a complex ecosystem in which diverse cancer and non-cancer cells interact and collectively determine tumor biology and response to therapies. We leverage single cell and spatial technologies, computational approaches and clinical collaborations to analyze the diversity of cells within human tumors. Our focus is on identifying important tumor subpopulations that mediate invasion and immune escape in the context of extracellular matrix remodelling. Our ultimate goal is to levareg this knowledge to develop better cancer treatments.
